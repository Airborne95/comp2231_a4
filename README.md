**For this assignment the following was accomplished:**

Implemented a Decision Tree\
Implemented a tree balancing method for a linked implementation using brute force.

**Background Info:**
These PDFs depict the various trees constructed in this assignment.\
"BackpainTree.pdf" is a visual of the Backpain Decision tree.\
Additionally, for the Backpain Decision Tree, three traversals of the decision tree are simulated.\
To run these tests, run the BackPainAnalyzer class. The previously mentioned tests will run after you are given the chance to traverse the tree through input.\
The "SummerActivityTree.pdf" Tree is a visual of the Summer Activity Tree. You can traverse through this tree by running the SunnyActivityAnalyzer class.\
The "bruteUnbalancedTree.pdf" shows the tree before it has been balanced.\
The "bruteBalancedTree.pdf" shows the tree after it has been balanced.\
To traverse these trees run the BruteBalanceDriver class.
